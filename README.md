# PDFCombine
This is a simple easy-to-use Script I created to quickly combine multiple pdf files in a folder.

# How to use it
1. Place the pdf files as well as PDF_combine.py in the same folder.
2. Ensure that the files are arranged in the desired order
3. Double click on PDF.combiner.py and a new file named combined_pdf will be created in the same folder.

# Note
You might need to install python to run PDF_combine.py
